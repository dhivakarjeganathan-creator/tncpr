i want you to implement this function _generate_schedule_query.

This function should generate a sql query.
schedule is the input.

select time_period, tz from time_schedulings 
where name = ‘{schedule}’ and enabled = true;

when you execute the above query, you will get following format for time_period
"[{""from"": 32400000, ""to"": 64800000}]"

and for tz you will get values like this below - which shows the timezone
"America/Chicago"
"GMT"
"US/Central"
"US/Eastern"

the timeperiod “from” and “to” are in milliseconds. I want to convert to fromtime and endtime
and tz is the timezone. i want to convert the fromtime/tz to a time in UTC timezone and also the endtime/tz to provide the time in UTC timezone.

i want to construct a where clause like “ and timestamp >= ‘{fromtime}’ and timestamp <= ‘{endtime}’ ”
